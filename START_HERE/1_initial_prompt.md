> Set up a new whack-a-mole project using modern React. The requirements are in c:\dev_claude\whack-a-mole\assignment\Practical_test_sr_profiles_webdev.pdf - an example can be seen here @assignment\example_game.png  - stick to the requirements. Use your @agent-deep-research-expert to find assets that can be used as placeholders, use @agent-react-expert to do the actual setup, @agent-react-testing-expert to implement unit & integration testing, and have @agent-uncle-bob-clean-code critique the code and make sure you follow clean code practices and use @agent-react-state-expert to do state management

● I'll help you set up a modern React whack-a-mole game following the requirements. Let me first read the PDF to understand the full requirements, then coordinate the specialized
  agents to build this properly.

● Read(assignment\Practical_test_sr_profiles_webdev.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (1.7MB)

● Now I'll create a comprehensive todo list and coordinate the specialized agents to build this whack-a-mole game properly.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Research and find suitable placeholder assets for the game
     ☐ Set up React project with TypeScript and Redux
     ☐ Create backend service for score and leaderboard data
     ☐ Implement game board with 3x4 mole grid
     ☐ Add mole pop-up logic with RNG and timing
     ☐ Implement whacking mechanics and score tracking
     ☐ Add 2-minute game timer functionality
     ☐ Create leaderboard component showing top 10 players
     ☐ Implement state management with Redux
     ☐ Write unit and integration tests
     ☐ Apply clean code principles and refactor
     ☐ Style the game to match the example

● Now I'll start by using the deep-research agent to find suitable assets, then coordinate the other agents to build the game according to the requirements.

● Let's first check what files we have and then run the game to see the current state:

● List(.)
  ⎿  Listed 78 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let's install dependencies and run the game to see how it looks:

● Let me fix the import/export issue:

● Read(src\types\game.types.ts)
  ⎿  Read 45 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The types file looks correct. Let me check the gameSlice import:

● Read(src\store\slices\gameSlice.ts)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The import looks correct. The issue might be with TypeScript compilation. Let me check if there's a compilation issue and restart the dev server:

● Bash(pkill -f "npm run dev" || true)
  ⎿  /usr/bin/bash: pkill: command not found

> ok continue

● Let me continue styling the Mole component to better match the desert/sand theme:
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> but it doesn't even work yet forget styling

● You're right! Let's fix the functionality first. Let me check what's happening with the application:

● Bash(npm run dev)
  ⎿  Error: Command timed out after 5s

     > whack-a-mole@1.0.0 dev
     > concurrently "npm run dev:frontend" "npm run dev:backend"

     … +11 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

● The servers are running. Let me check if there are any TypeScript compilation errors:

● Bash(npx tsc --noEmit)
  ⎿  (No content)

● No TypeScript errors. Let me check the browser console for errors. First, let's look at the main App component to see how everything is connected:

● Read(src\App.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 78 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the main.tsx to see how the Redux store is provided:

● Read(src\main.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Good, Redux is properly set up. Let me check if the backend server is running correctly:

● Bash(curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/health)
  ⎿  {
       "status": "OK",
       "timestamp": "2025-08-07T14:19:57.876Z"
     … +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● Backend is working. Let me check the leaderboard endpoint:

● Bash(curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/leaderboard)
  ⎿  [
       {
         "id": "1",
     … +29 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Backend is working fine. Let me check the GameBoard component to see how the game is starting:

● Read(src\components\GameBoard\GameBoard.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 115 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the GameControls to see how the game is started:

● Read(src\components\GameControls\GameControls.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 116 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The game structure looks good. Let me test if the frontend is accessible:

● Bash(curl -s http://localhost:3001/ | head -20)
  ⎿  <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
     … +7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Ah! There's the error. The GameState export is missing from the types file. Let me check and fix it:

● Bash(grep -n "GameState" C:/dev_claude/whack-a-mole/src/types/game.types.ts)
  ⎿  7:export interface GameState {

● The GameState is indeed exported. The issue might be with the Vite dev server cache. Let me stop the server and restart it properly:
